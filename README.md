[Play online](https://ineedauniqueuserna.me/starman/)

Here is the repository for the CS179N Spring 2022 game project, *Starman 64*.

*Starman* is a space shmup about superpowered astronauts. Choose one of four Heroes of Earth (each with two unique attacks) and fight through five levels to escape the Anomalous Zone and defeat the villainous Ad Dastardly Astra. Destroy the Boss Beacons and fly through the Boss Rings to summon the boss, and destroy the boss to advance to the next level. On the way, you'll have to fight waves of enemy drones and manage your health, energy, and fuel bars.

*Starman* is made in Godot engine. All art assets are originally produced for this project by Alex Chen
